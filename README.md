# **Doclify — A Modern Blog Platform Built with Next.js 16**

**Doclify is an early-stage, modern blog platform built with _Next.js 16 (App Router)_.**

It currently provides essential features such as:

- Blog creation with a rich-text editor (Tiptap)
- Google OAuth authentication
- Cloudinary image uploads
- MongoDB persistence with Mongoose
- A mostly **RSC-first architecture**, with client components only where needed

The project is still in **active development**, and several areas are being improved, including:

- Caching strategies
- Data handling and performance optimization
- UI/UX polish
- Better developer experience and internal tooling

⚠️ **Note:** Update and delete functionalities for blog posts are not yet implemented.  
The developer is actively working on these features and other enhancements.

Doclify is evolving rapidly, and more refinements and improvements will be added as the project grows.

## 🧩 **Important Design Decisions**

- **Server Actions instead of API Routes** → less boilerplate, better type safety
- **React Cache (`cache()`)** → dedupe DB queries during SSR
- **Slug-based URLs** → cleaner, SEO-friendly blog links
- **Auto-generated usernames** from email using slugify
- **Flexible schema design** using Mongoose (good for tags & categories)
